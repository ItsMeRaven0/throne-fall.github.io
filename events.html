			<p>Huge balancing update with many changes and reworks.</p>
			<p><strong>TOWERS REWORK:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defense towers have brand new and reworked level 2 and level 3 upgrades.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>ETERNAL TRIALS - SEASON 2:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Complete rebalancing of the eternal trials wave generator and a fresh start with an empty highscore table.</li>
				<li>More difficult, new enemy preview, less random, more predictable, unwanted perks can be disabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>QUALITY OF LIFE:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>New unit control hotkeys, opening up huge micro potential and saving you tons of time during the day</li>
				<li>New command hotkey that selects / places only one unit type at a time (allows for easy sorting of clumped up units)</li>
				<li>Snappier keyboard controls and mouse movement added as a control option.</li>
				<li>Next day gold preview in the pause menu</li>
				<li>Tower range indicators</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>BALANCING:</strong></p>
			<p>Almost every perk and castle center upgrade has been touched in some shape or form. Some highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your berserks have a brand new jump attack and your flails have health steal.</li>
				<li>Self-healing is a separate value now and no longer scales with your max health pool.</li>
				<li>Quick slings have to stop firing to reload.</li>
				<li>Mill upgrades are more powerful.</li>
				<li>Way more than we can even list here...</li>
			</ul>
